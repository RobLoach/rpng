# rpng benchmark

This benchmark implements the following actions:

  1. Generate a set of random images with a random amount of random color pixels (randColFactor)
  2. Compress and export PNG images using stb_image_write (STBIW)
  3. Compress and export PNG images using rpng (RPNG)
  4. Load generated PNGs (STBIW and RPNG) with stb_image and compare pixel data

## Notes

  - All compression/decompression times are measured from memory operations, 
    this way file access costs are ignored
  - Compression time measures include png image data filtering process, 
    depending on data prefilter, compression could be better but also slower

## Configuration

The 4 processes to be performed can be configured depending on user needs, please note
that some of those processes could take long time (> 1 hour) depending on the system

```c
    #define PROCESS_GENERATE_RANDOM_IMAGES
    #define PROCESS_COMPRESS_EXPORT_STBIW
    #define PROCESS_COMPRESS_EXPORT_RPNG
    #define PROCESS_LOAD_COMPARE_STBIW_RPNG
```

## Dependencies
  - raylib 4.6-dev  - STBIW interface to load and save images from memory, file management
  - rpng 1.1-dev    - RPNG with latest changes to generated png file streams
  - rprand 1.0      - Pseudo-random number generator, used to get random image positions
